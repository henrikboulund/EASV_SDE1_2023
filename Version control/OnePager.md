# OnePager - Version Control
No matter if you work in a team with a lot of team members or you work on a project yourself it is usefull to use a version control system (VCS).

Versionizing means giving your code versions. You can therefore work with different versions of your code in parallel.

Using a version control can be a mess, if your team do not consider how to use it. We call this codersideration for "Having a branch strategy".

## Commands

```git-bash
git init
```
Create a local git repositories by creating a folder called .git. This is a hidden folder, so you need to allow "Show hidden files", to see it.

```git-bash
